# HARNESS THE POWER OF FUNCTIONS TO BUILD COMPOSABLE RACK APPLICATIONS

What's a function? A function is a black box that takes an input and returns an
output. Similarly, from the outside, HTTP requests take some request data to
give it back as a response. Functions may compose if the output of one matches
the input of the next one. web_pipe helps you build rack applications by
plugging small process units that progressively create a response from a given
request.

## Marc Busqu√©

I'm a software developer with more than 13 years of experience. I've been
working in Ruby for the most part. Still, I've also programmed, whether
professionally or for personal projects, in Elixir and Haskell. The experience
with functional programming and the flexibility and expressiveness of Ruby
pushes me to try to blend the latter to adopt new paradigms.

Birds of a feather flock together, so I eventually joined dry-rb & hanami
organizations. Currently, I'm helping build Hanami 2.
